 # using the components
 1. the location picker is invoked declaratively from a button , link etc via the navPush attribut. In this repo , you will find the example in the home component:
 **<button ion-button [navPush]="pushPage" [navParams]="params">select location</button>**.
 YOU MUST IMPORT THE locationPickerPageComponent in the page from where you are goign to invoke this.
  
 2. when the locaiton picker is invoked and a location is selected , the location picker pushes the select contacts component , passing the selected address to it.
 once the contacts are selected and the continue button is clicked , the **confirm()** function in the component collects the address and selected contacts for passing on. This function has been stubbed for now.
 
 #  Important 
 the contacts page will not work in the browser and will fail, please test it with emulation or a real device.
 
 # Select Photos component
 
 ## plugins used:
 1. ionic native photos - https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/photo-library/   . follow installation steps in the page

## notes:
1. The getPhotos function returns an array of photo blobs .. These can be directly uploaded using formData.
2. The photos will not show up in the latest webview (Wk) .. when testing ensure that the app has the older webview .
